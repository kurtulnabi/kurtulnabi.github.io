In each location, kids find a variety of objects and characters that they can move around, Experiment with and tell stories about going shopping, setting the table for lunch, washing a car, or taking a nap. Some locations offer themed options for interaction such as styling and coloring hair in the salon. Game play is open-ended as there are no rules or objectives"

            "This straightforward virtual space offers the standard fare for app-based imaginative free play. PEPI HOUSE has just enough characters, props, and settings to appeal to kids and inspire them to explore with role-playing, story telling, and pretend play. But, PEPI HOUSE doesn't quite live up to the Toca Life series, which is the giant in this genre, in its level of detail and options for customized play. There's also no built in capacity for recording, which limits kids' ability to document their imaginative stories. Plus, there are a couple of strange messages in the background about a makeover and being rich, On the positive side, the free download comes with one free location -- which kids will quickly tire of. But, the rest unlocks with a one-time in-app purchase. Kids who are into this kind of open-ended imaginary worlds may enjoy trying PEPI HOUSE out to see if it inspires them. But don't forget to also give them lots of opportunities for off screen imaginative play as well"

How can kids enjoy digital media in balance with other activities?, Provide opportunities for off screen imaginative play with props, old clothes to dress up in, and stuffed animals, dolls, or action figures. Remember that kids don't need anything fancy: Even an extra blanket, a cardboard box, and some paper tower rolls can turn into all sorts of magical things!"
