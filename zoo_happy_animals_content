          "There’s a lot to think about when you’re perusing the animal trade centre in Zoo - Happy Animals. Unlike Zoo Tycoon, where animals were either female or male, and there was little else to think about. You’ll now see longevity, fertility, size, and immunity. Animals can even get sick and will need to be quarantined and treated before you can place them in their new habitat. To breed animals in Zoo - Happy Animals, you’ll need to keep an eye on fertility, the animal’s social happiness, and the breeding conditions you’ll need to meet in the Zoopedia. Here’s how to increase your chances of breeding animals in Zoo - Happy Animals"

          "If your Zoo - Happy Animals keepers aren’t refilling your food, it may not be down to their laziness, as they seem to have a better attitude that most sim AIs – yep, we’re looking at you, Two Point Hospital. As long as keepers have a staff room to keep up their energy, they’re generally a happy bunch. So, why are your Zoo - Happy Animals animals starving?"

          "There’s so much to keep on top of in Zoo - Happy Animals, so it’s a small ask that you’re not getting constant notifications that your animals are starving and likely to die. It’s also frustrating that you can’t pick up and place keepers quickly in locations to stop this happening, something we’re used to doing in other sim management games for a quick fix. However, there are a couple of ways you can try to prevent your animals for going without food"

          "If your Zoo - Happy Animals animals are stressed, you’ll soon know about it. You’ll get bombarded with notifications and their welfare bar will be low and in the red. So, here’s a few things you can try to combat your Zoo - Happy Animals animals stress levels.\n\nAdd a hard shelter – An animal will become stressed if it’s trying to hide from guests and can’t find any privacy, adding a hard shelter in Zoo - Happy Animals, or a shelter at all, can help their stress levels.\nHave one-way looking glass – Guests want to see the animals, fair enough. But the animals don’t want to see them. By adding one-way looking glasses, creating the illusion that the animals have privacy is another way to combat stress levels"

          "https://img.youtube.com/vi/G4Lr6KUDnm4/maxresdefault.jpg",
          "Expand the habitat – If an animal is feeling cramped in its enclosure, having to share the space with too many other animals, it naturally becomes agitated and needs some room to breath. If you’ve built around the habitat and can’t expand it, think about removing some animals and creating a separate habitat for them"

          "Relocate food and water bowls – Change the location of your food and water bowls around the enclosure, encouraging the keeper to return to the location and feed your animals.\nKeep a staff room and keeper room close to the habitat – Keepers need to prepare food in a keeper room, so it’s worth having one close to your enclosure. They also need staff rooms to take a break in to prevent burnout and make them productive"

          "Assign keepers to habitats – You’ll need to keep an eye on work zones, and make sure that every animal habitat has an assigned keeper. This can be a pain to keep on top of, but by making sure there’s a keeper managing your enclosure, they’ll unlikely be forgotten.\nRemove enrichment feeders – It’s tempting to cram your habitat with enrichment feeders when you see that red welfare bar and your animals need for enriched food. But keepers will actually stop filling up normal food, prioritising enrichment feeders"
